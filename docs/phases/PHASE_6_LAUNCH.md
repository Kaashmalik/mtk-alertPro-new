## Step 1: App Signing Setup

### Generate Upload Key
```bash
cd apps/mobile/android

# Generate keystore
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -storetype PKCS12 \
  -keystore mtk-alertpro-upload.keystore \
  -alias mtkalertpro \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000

# Store password securely - NEVER commit to git
```

### `apps/mobile/android/gradle.properties`
```properties
# Add these (values from .env or CI secrets)
MTK_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=mtk-alertpro-upload.keystore
MTK_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=****
MTK_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=mtkalertpro
MTK_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=****
```

### `apps/mobile/android/app/build.gradle`
```groovy
android {
    ...
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('MTK_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(MTK_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword MTK_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias MTK_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword MTK_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Production Build

### Using EAS Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure secrets
eas secret:create --name SENTRY_DSN --value "your-dsn"
eas secret:create --name SUPABASE_URL --value "your-url"
eas secret:create --name SUPABASE_ANON_KEY --value "your-key"

# Build production AAB
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Download AAB when complete
eas build:list --platform android
```

### Manual Build (Alternative)
```bash
cd apps/mobile/android

# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build release AAB
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Output: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```
